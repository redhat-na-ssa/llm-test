Although ""Amazing Grace"" set to ""New Britain"" was popular, other versions existed regionally. Primitive Baptists in the Appalachian region often used ""New Britain"" with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of ""Amazing Grace"" to other folk songs, including titles such as ""In the Pines"", ""Pisgah"", ""Primrose"", and ""Evan"", as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists. A tune named ""Arlington"" accompanied Newton's verses as much as ""New Britain"" for a time in the late 19th century. Two musical arrangers named Dwight Moody and Ira Sankey heralded another religious revival in the cities of the U.S. and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of gospel music, and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them. Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and ""Amazing Grace"" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as ""New Britain"". A publisher named Edwin Othello Excell gave the version of ""Amazing Grace"" set to ""New Britain"" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving ""New Britain"" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in Uncle Tom's Cabin were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of ""Amazing Grace"" became the standard form of the song in American churches.Answer:"
